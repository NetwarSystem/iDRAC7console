There are complex, fragmented, unworkable "solutions" for accessing an iDRAC7 from Linux posted all over the place. They can best be described as "a dumpster fire someone tried to extinguish with a JDAM strike".

I am exercising my prerogative as an OG BOFH to replace they and their authors with a very small shell script.

If you were looking for an iDRAC6 solution the best thing going is this:
